###ScrumBoard
An Interactive board for Agile task management.

We probably need a todo list of possible things to implement in this here applicaion.

Will continually work on this list as more user evaulations / feedback is conducted.

These are suggestions and by no means a list of things it has to do.

Not currently in order of priority (do this later)

###Known Bug List
1. Add a new note and move it to a different column than “Backlog”. Put cursor off note then back on again. Notice how the “Backlog” column suddenly lightens up as if the user’s cursor is in it?
2. Scrolling down reveals the white horizontal line across the bottom.
3. Snapping on the top is to the top of the header line rather than top of note area.
4. Snapping on right column wall looks slightly different than snapping on the left column wall.

###Suggested Feature List

Move sticky note to top of stack (as a brief explanation)

Sticky note colours - alter colour of sticky notes
Chat functionality - style of Facebook corner chat / moveable Twitch popout chat window

Edit column header text
Possibly add column width alteration / change number of colours to 3 or 5
Export / print / save image copy of page
Alter column colours - either user selects colour of have colour toggle (night time mode)

Highlight when a user selects a note (see when / which other notes a user currently working on)

Don't allow two users to drag the same note.

Resize text - both column headers and note text

Make toolbar smaller / potentially compact on phones (look at http://material.io/resizer/#url=http%3A%2F%2Fscrumboard.info.tm) to see how site looks across different screen sizes. Would look good in report to say considered and accounted for this. 

Right click - if the user right clicks you get the default right click. One user evaulation asked what happens when someone right clicks on a sticky note.

When the user clicks on a note to move it they sometimes go into the note editing feature - perhaps double click to edit note.
