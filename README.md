###ScrumBoard
An Interactive board for Agile task management.

We probably need a todo list of possible things to implement in this here applicaion.

Will continually work on this list as more user evaulations / feedback is conducted.

These are suggestions and by no means a list of things it has to do.

Not currently in order of priority (do this later)

###Known Bug List
1. Add a new note and move it to a different column than “Backlog”. Put cursor off note then back on again. Notice how the “Backlog” column suddenly lightens up as if the user’s cursor is in it?
2. Scrolling down reveals the white horizontal line across the bottom.
3. Snapping on the top is to the top of the header line rather than top of note area.
4. Snapping on right column wall looks slightly different than snapping on the left column wall.
5. Entering too much text in a note / column header - would suggest limiting header to N characters and just resizing note according to amount of entered text.

###Potential Final Features:
1. Sticky note colours - alter colour of sticky notes
2. Edward wanted a chat like / comment feature for users of the app. Quickest implementation might be an anonymous notice board type thing.
3. Ability to lockdown a particular board to stop users without a password from editing it - Paulius did point out that without user accounts / details there is no straightforward way to reset the password for a particular board. 

Paulius proposed we randomly assign a colour when creating a note.

I proposed we have a colour platte button on the top left each note to change its colour

An easy solution would be to combine the two ideas and have like a circle in the top left of each note which changes it to the next colour in a cycle of say 5 “carefully” selected colours.

###Suggested Feature List

Chat functionality - style of Facebook corner chat / moveable Twitch popout chat window

Possibly add column width alteration / change number of colours to 3 or 5
Export / print / save image copy of page
Alter column colours - either user selects colour of have colour toggle (night time mode)

Highlight when a user selects a note (see when / which other notes a user currently working on)

Resize text - both column headers and note text

Make toolbar smaller / potentially compact on phones (look at http://material.io/resizer/#url=http%3A%2F%2Fscrumboard.info.tm) to see how site looks across different screen sizes. Would look good in report to say considered and accounted for this. 

Right click - if the user right clicks you get the default right click. One user evaulation asked what happens when someone right clicks on a sticky note.

When the user clicks on a note to move it they sometimes go into the note editing feature - perhaps double click to edit note.
